# Match Logger Web App

## Overview

The Match Logger Web App is a user-friendly interface designed for logging various events during a football match. Users can interact directly with a graphical representation of a football pitch, marking specific locations where events occur and categorizing them accordingly. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience. Events are captured with precise (x, y) coordinates, a timestamp, and an associated category, which can be chosen from a pop-up menu of categorized buttons. The app also provides functionalities to undo the last logged event, reset the entire log, and export the logged data as a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features and Usage

To log an event, simply click on the relevant location on the pitch, and then select the appropriate event category from the pop-up window. The app supports a wide range of event categories, including different types of passes, shots, defensive actions, and more. For convenience, the categories are grouped into relevant sections such as "First Touch", "Possession", "Last Touch", and "Defensive Actions". The app ensures visual feedback by displaying red markers on the pitch where events are logged. Users can interact with the app on various devices, as it is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly. The 'Reset Log' button clears all logged events, the 'Undo Event' button removes the most recent event, and the 'Export Data' button generates a CSV file containing all logged data, including (x, y) coordinates, event categories, timestamps, and a unique identifier for each event. The app is hosted on GitHub Pages, providing easy access and use without the need for local installation. To get started, simply navigate to the provided URL and start logging events during your football match.

For the best experience, it is recommended to use the app in a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. Ensure that your browser is up to date to avoid any compatibility issues. The source code and additional documentation can be found in this GitHub repository. Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to the project to enhance its functionality and user experience. Enjoy logging your football events with Match Logger!
