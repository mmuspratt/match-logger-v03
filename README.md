# Match Logger Web App

## Overview

The Match Logger Web App is designed for logging events during a football/soccer match. Users interact directly with a graphical representation of a football pitch, marking specific locations where events occur and categorizing them accordingly  (e.g. pass, shot) . The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Events are captured with precise (x, y) coordinates, a timestamp, and an associated category, which users select from a pop-up menu of buttons immediately after logging the (x, y) location of the event. The app also provides functionalities to undo the last logged event, reset the entire log, and export the logged data as a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features and Usage

To log an event, click on the relevant location on the pitch, and then select the appropriate event category from the pop-up window. The app ensures visual feedback by displaying red markers on the pitch where events are logged. Users can interact with the app on various devices. The 'Reset Log' button clears all logged events, the 'Undo Event' button removes the most recent event, and the 'Export Data' button generates a CSV file containing all logged data, including (x, y) coordinates, event categories, timestamps, and a unique identifier for each event.

For the best experience, it is recommended to use the app in a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. Ensure that your browser is up to date to avoid any compatibility issues.
